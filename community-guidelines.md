**TL;DR** Use Common sense. ğŸ§  If you think you'll get a warning for it, don't do it!

ğŸŒ¸ **Be kind** and friendly to all members.

ğŸ’¬ **Actively contribute** to the guild and building up, but **avoid discussing things that are generally considered illegal, offensive, insulting, or disturbing**.

ğŸ›‘ Try to **avoid conflict** as much as possible in your public messages. If you happen to offend someone, politely talking to them via DM is a good way to work out any issues.

ğŸ“¢ Remember to **Read** the rules given by our Guild Management Team.
